## Before we get started

We need to first make sure that we have everything we need to create our first Angular project:

1. Make sure Node & NPM are installed;
	1. Open Terminal (Mac)/CMD (Windows)
	1. Type `node -v` and hit enter. _If a version number shows, you have Node installed. 👍 (You can skip to step 2)_
		1. If **not**, [download and install both here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 👍 (You can skip to step 2)_
	1. Type `npm -v` into the terminal and hit enter. _If a version number shows, you have NPM installed 👍👍 (You can skip to step 2)_
		1. If **not**, [download and install it here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 👍👍
1. Make sure Angular CLI is installed
	1. Open Terminal (Mac)/CMD (Windows)
	1. Type `ng version` and hit enter. _If you version info about Angular you already have Angular CLI installed 👍👍👍 (You are done 🥳)_
	1. If **not**, type `npm install -g @angular/cli` into the terminal and hit enter. Once this is done, NPM will be installed 👍👍👍
